## Project Idea
> En4orcer's minor paper summarizing the future project

### Idea
> Keep it simple.

- Mimic everyday cash
- Universally usable
- Create stable jobs
- Decentralised finance *(aka DeFi)*
- Become a medium for daily transactions

These are the 5 main ideas for our project.

### Elaborate

- **Mimic everyday cash**
    - This is a vital feature if we want the project to succeed. Everyday cash is fungible so therefore Bitcoin and Fiat are not the same. Privacy shouldn't be an option.
- **Universally usable**
    - The fact we have different currencies depending on what geolocation we are in is absurd. *"Why can't everyone use the same form of payment globally?"*
- **Create stable jobs**
    - Jobs are not safe in this day and age depending on who we work for and where we work. I want the project to give anyone a chance to earn a stable income by working for the project and get paid to do so.
- **Decentralised finance**
    - The whole purpose in cryptographic currencies was to defeat the object of banks and what they represent. Having on-chain, legitimate financial features to mimic what banks claim they do would be one big step closer to beating them.
- **Become a medium for daily transactions**
    - This could fall under the same category as the second statement.
    
### Realistic

Most projects fade away because they usually lack the money to run the needed resources for that said project. I have devised a plan to create a *premine* (everybody hates that word but we're being realistic) to help oversea our work for a number of years to support the idea of a stable income for project members and contributors. These funds will also be used to help market the project to allow more potential new users.

### Specs
> Nothing is final here.

| Attribute | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Supply | ??? | The total supply of the Blockchain should be a high figure to support the idea of longevity. The higher supply, the more coins that can be produced overtime. |
| Premine | ???% | The premine should only be a minor percentage of the supply but enough to sustain the project for years to come. Premine supports the project and its ideas/plans for the future. |
| Block Reward | ??? | The Block Reward should be low in amount to counteract the high supply of the Blockchain. A Low Block Rewards means you won't be sat on *millions* of coin that barely hold value. |
